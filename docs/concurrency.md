# Concurrency details

Read this before adding a long-running calculation, wiring up a progress bar, or reaching for `assumeIsolated`.

The basics are in `CLAUDE.md`: the model layer is actor-based, and two AppKit callbacks (`awakeFromNib()`, `Timer` blocks) are
`nonisolated` and so wrap their bodies in `MainActor.assumeIsolated { … }`.

## Progress reporting from a long calculation

Both long calculations report progress the same way, and new ones should follow it. The calculation takes an optional
`AsyncStream<…>.Continuation`; the UI creates the stream with `.bufferingNewest(1)`, drains it in a
`Task { @MainActor in for await … }`, and finishes the continuation when the work returns (**including on the error path** —
otherwise the drain task outlives the calculation). `AsyncStream.Continuation` is `Sendable`, so it crosses into an actor with no
`assumeIsolated` and no `DispatchQueue.main.async`; `.bufferingNewest(1)` means the solver never blocks on a slow UI; and because
each `for await` iteration resumes on the main actor, AppKit actually gets to redraw *between* updates. That last point is the whole
reason the pattern works where ad-hoc main-thread hops historically didn't.

Two things learned the hard way, both worth preserving:

- **An indeterminate `NSProgressIndicator` animates off the main run loop**, so it keeps spinning even when the main thread is wedged. A determinate bar does not. If a converted bar stalls, that is a real main-thread block being *exposed*, not introduced.
- **A bar that never moves usually means the work isn't completing incrementally**, not that the plumbing is broken. Check whether the underlying units of work actually finish at different times before touching the UI code — see the bounded-concurrency note in `PchFiniteElementPackage`'s `CLAUDE.md`.

Throttle the emitting side to roughly what the bar can show. `SimulateRK45` reports only when its fraction advances ≥0.2% (a run is
10⁵+ steps; a 100pt bar has ~100 useful positions) and checks `Task.isCancelled` at the **top of its loop** rather than at the
throttled report site — a long run of rejected steps would otherwise never reach a check. `FrequencyDomainSolver.Sweep` reports
every `points/200` completed solves; unlike the RK45 bar, its progress is genuinely **linear in wall-clock time**, because every
contour point costs the same.

## `@MainActor` is not mutual exclusion — `recalculateModel` is gated

`AppController` is `@MainActor`, and that guarantees nothing about a long `async` method running only once at a time. `@MainActor`
serialises *steps*, not *calls*: every `await` is a suspension point at which the main actor is free to run something else, and
`recalculateModel` is minutes long and `await`s at nearly every line. Any menu action that spawns a `Task { … }` — which is all of
them — could therefore start a second full recalculation on top of the first.

The symptom, when it happened, was interleaving one coil and then interleaving a *second* coil before the first inductance
calculation had finished. Two recalculations then ran at once over state that is inherently single-run, and each one clobbered the
other's:

| Shared state | What the overlap did |
|---|---|
| `currentFePhase` | The newer run overwrote it. `didFinishInductanceCalculation()` read it back and so reported on the *other* run's half-built phase: no inductance matrix on it yet, so it turned the light red and returned before ever setting `inductanceIsValid`. |
| `runningInductanceTask` | Each run overwrote the other's handle and then nil'd it on completion, so **Cancel Inductance could no longer reach the calculation that was actually running**. |
| `indCalcProgInd` | Two `InductanceProgress` streams drove the one bar from different fractions, and each run zeroed it as it started — the bar appeared to climb part-way and restart, over and over. |
| the `PhaseModel` | The older run's `fePhase` was built from the pre-edit segment store. It kept walking `CoilSegments()` for eddy losses and FE currents while the newer run swapped Segments underneath it, and then wrote an inductance matrix computed for a winding that no longer existed. |

`recalculateModel` is now a **gate**; the work lives in `PerformRecalculation`. A new request calls
`CancelRecalculationInFlight()`, then queues a task that waits out the old run's unwind before touching anything. Points worth
keeping:

- **Supersede, don't block.** The in-flight result is *stale*, not merely late — its caller has already changed the geometry it was computed for. Disabling the editing menu items instead (the way `simulateMenuItem` gates on `runningSimulationTask == nil`) would lock the user out for the length of a full inductance run to protect an answer that is already garbage.
- **`Task {}` is unstructured and does not inherit cancellation**, so cancelling the gate does *not* reach the inner `inductanceTask` on its own. `withTaskCancellationHandler` forwards it. The Cancel Inductance menu item still cancels `runningInductanceTask` directly and lands in the same `catch`.
- **A superseded run must stay silent.** It legitimately reaches the `feSectionCount == coilSegments.count` guard (the store changed under it) and can fail anywhere in the FE solve, so every alert on those paths is guarded by `!Task.isCancelled`, and the `catch` treats `Task.isCancelled` the same as a `CancellationError` — a cut-off run surfaces as a mesh or solver failure just as readily.
- **Cancel before mutating.** `updateModel` signals cancellation at the *top*, before the segment swap, so the old run's next checkpoint sees it rather than waking up in a store that is half old and half new.
- **`didFinishInductanceCalculation` takes its phase as a parameter.** Reading `currentFePhase` told it which phase was *newest*, not which one it was reporting on. The gate makes the overlap impossible; the parameter makes it unstateable.

## Bounded parallelism in the frequency sweep

The frequency sweep bounds its own parallelism to one task per core (primed, then topped up as each completes) rather than
launching all ~2000 solves at once. Each in-flight solve holds an nx×nx complex matrix — ~2.5 MB at nx=400 — so an unbounded
`TaskGroup` would need several GB of live matrices. Keep the bound if you touch that loop.

## `assumeIsolated`

It *traps* if the assumption is ever wrong, so only use it where the main thread is guaranteed — otherwise hop with
`Task { @MainActor in … }`. The existing sites were exercised by hand (design-file load → inductance/capacitance → simulation →
coil-results animation → pinch-zoom) when Swift 6 mode was adopted, so a trap firing in one of them signals a genuine regression,
not a pre-existing latent bug.
