/// The finite-element side of one phase: the axisymmetric (r, z) model of the core window, the coil sections in it, and the
/// quantities the program takes back out of it — the segment-to-segment inductance matrix, and each segment's eddy losses.
///
/// # One terminal per segment
///
/// `PchAxiSymFE` builds its flux-linkage matrix per *terminal*: `Λ_ts = b_tᵀ x_s`, one solve per terminal against a single
/// factorization. A winding-level model gives a terminal to a whole winding and gets a 2×2 or 3×3 impedance matrix out. This
/// program needs the matrix one row per **Segment**, so every section here is given its own terminal number, equal to its index
/// in `sections`. Column `s` of the matrix is then the field of one disc excited on its own, and the matrix that comes back is
/// exactly the self- and mutual-inductance matrix the impulse solver runs on.
///
/// The real excitation — every segment carrying its own share of the amp-turns — is expressible in the same model, since a
/// terminal current is set per terminal and there is one per segment. So the eddy-loss solve and the inductance sweep share one
/// mesh and one factorization; only the right-hand side differs.
///
/// # Boundary conditions
///
/// Rabin's arrangement, which is the one the program's physics is founded on:
///
/// * the core leg and both yokes are infinitely permeable, so flux enters them perpendicularly — `.fluxNormal`;
/// * the tank wall is a flux line, `u = rA_φ = 0` — `.fluxParallel`.
///
/// The tank condition is not a detail. Every column of an inductance matrix excites one section *alone*, which is a net
/// ampere-turn-unbalanced excitation, and a model with every boundary flux-normal (Andersen's arrangement, the right one for a
/// balanced short-circuit leakage run) is pure Neumann and has no solution for it: `PchAxiSymFE` rejects such an excitation
/// rather than let the gauge node absorb the imbalance and return a plausible, meaningless field. Giving the tank a Dirichlet
/// condition makes the system nonsingular, and it is also the closer reading of a real tank, whose steel is many skin depths
/// thick at power frequency and behaves as a flux barrier rather than as a permeable return path.
///
/// The domain starts at the core surface (`InnerRadialBoundary.coreSurface`) rather than at the axis, so the core leg itself is
/// not meshed — the same window the old model used, and the same one FLD8/FLD12 use.
