//  Created by Peter Huber on 2026-08-11.
//
//  The plot both stress-profile windows draw into: a quantity against height, the allowable drawn across it, and the worst point
//  named in the body of the plot.
//
//  It started inside AxialStressProfileWindow and came out here when StressProfileWindow (the radial profiles) was given the same
//  furniture. One view rather than two matters more than the file count: the two graphs are read side by side, so a difference in
//  where the ticks fall, what the allowable looks like or what the annotation says would read as a difference in the DATA. What
//  varies between the two is passed in - see `Plot`.
//
//  WHY THIS IS NOT CoilResultsDisplayView. It needs a second series (the allowable), a labelled x axis on a fixed 100 mm grid,
//  markers at named heights and an annotation block inside the plot; that view has none of those and its two remaining users -
//  the animated coil results and the initial distribution - want none of them. This one draws in plain view coordinates
//  (bounds == frame, one point = one unit), which is what lets it hand `AxisScale` a `pointSize` of 1 and reuse `DrawYAxis`
//  unchanged. CoilResultsDisplayView instead sets its bounds to the data rectangle, which is why it needs two passes to settle a
//  margin and why everything drawn in it has to be scaled by hand.
//
//  THE POINTS ARE THE MODEL'S OWN RESOLUTION AND THE LINE BETWEEN THEM IS INTERPOLATION - one value per disc-to-disc gap in the
//  axial graph, one per sampled height in the radial one. The line is drawn because a profile reads as a shape and a scatter of
//  dots does not; it is not evidence of anything between two points.
//
//  Both callers derive the allowable from the finding itself rather than re-evaluating it: allowable field is
//  averageField / averageUtilization and allowable ΔV is deltaV / averageUtilization, both exact because the field is linear in
//  the driving voltage. See docs/dielectric-stress.md.

        // sits near the top of the plot, and the empty half is underneath - the reverse of the ordinary stress profile, where the
        // curve is low against a limit drawn above it. With only top-anchored candidates the box had nowhere to go but on top of
        // the curve. It is last so that a tie still resolves the way it did before, and no existing graph moves.
