//  SelfTest.swift
//  ImpulseDistribution
//
//  Created by Peter Huber on 2026-08-06.
//
//  A scripted, non-interactive run of a KNOWN design, so that the program can be exercised end to end without anybody
//  sitting at the keyboard: load a design file, apply a fixed set of terminations, build the simulation model, solve
//  the initial distribution, and write a report.
//
//  WHY THIS EXISTS. There is no test target (see CLAUDE.md), and every route to a model otherwise starts at an
//  NSOpenPanel in AppController.handleOpenFile. That makes every check in this program a hand check, which is fine for
//  a one-off verification - DielectricStress.VerifySelf() and TurnLadderModel.VerifySelf() are exactly that - but no
//  use at all as a regression net, because nobody re-runs a hand check after an unrelated edit. This runs the whole
//  pipeline from a launch argument and leaves a text report behind.
//
//  HOW TO RUN IT. The app is launched with the scenario name as a launch argument. NSUserDefaults parses "-key value"
//  launch arguments into the defaults domain automatically, so there is no argument parsing here and no risk of the
//  test path being reachable from a normal launch:
//
//      /path/to/ImpulseDistribution.app/Contents/MacOS/ImpulseDistribution -PCH_SelfTest STME0999
//
//  Add "-PCH_SelfTestTransient YES" to also run the frequency-domain sweep. That is off by default because the sweep
//  is minutes of work and most edits that could break something break it in the assembly or the capacitance, both of
//  which the initial distribution already sees.
//
//  WHERE THE FIXTURE LIVES. The app is sandboxed with only 'user-selected.read-write', so a design file anywhere else
//  on the disk is unreadable without the open panel that granted access to it. The app's OWN container is always
//  readable, so the fixture is looked for in the container's Documents folder:
//
//      ~/Library/Containers/com.huberistech.Rabin2021/Data/Documents/
//
//  Copy the design file there before running. This is deliberately not solved with a temporary-exception entitlement:
//  that would change what the shipped app is allowed to read in order to run a test.
//
//  WHERE THE RESULTS GO. The full report is written to a text file beside the fixture in that same Documents folder,
//  and a one-line summary plus the last stage reached go into UserDefaults:
//
//      defaults read com.huberistech.Rabin2021 PCH_SelfTestSummary
//      defaults read com.huberistech.Rabin2021 PCH_SelfTestStage
//      cat ~/Library/Containers/com.huberistech.Rabin2021/Data/Documents/SelfTestReport-STME0999.txt
//
//  The stage breadcrumb is written and flushed before each step. If the run hangs - and it can, because the pipeline
//  raises NSAlerts on failure and a modal alert will sit there forever with nobody to dismiss it - that key says which
//  step it hung in.
//
//  WHAT IT CHECKS. Two different things, and it is worth keeping them apart:
//
//  1. A REGRESSION BASELINE. Parsed geometry, per-coil series and ground capacitance, and the computed initial
//     distribution, all printed to enough digits to diff. This does not know what the right answer is; it tells you
//     that today's answer is or is not yesterday's.
//
//  2. A COMPARISON AGAINST DELVECCHIO SECTION 13.5.1, "Uniform Capacitance Model". The continuum model replaces the
//     winding by a uniform ladder of series capacitance and capacitance to ground, and gives the initial distribution
//     in closed form as
//
//         V(x)/V = sinh(alpha*x) / sinh(alpha),     alpha = sqrt(Cg / Cs)
//
//     with x measured from the GROUNDED end (x = 0) to the line end (x = 1), Cg the winding's total capacitance to
//     ground and Cs the winding's total series capacitance (the series combination of the per-disc values, which is
//     what PhaseModel.CoilSeriesCapacitance returns).
//
//     This is an approximation and its disagreements are as informative as its agreements. It assumes Cg and Cs are
//     UNIFORM along the winding, which the real model's are not - the end discs get Stein/end-disc treatment and the
//     ground capacitance is not uniform at the ends either. It has no inductance at all, which is why only the t = 0+
//     distribution is compared and not the transient. And it has no second coil, which is the reason alpha is
//     reported twice, bracketed (see the note on ContinuumComparison).

    ///      ground, so after this neither side of the gap still carries a floating centre lead.

    ///      return path runs out of coil 2, through both halves of coil 3 in parallel, and to ground at coil 3's centre. Nothing
