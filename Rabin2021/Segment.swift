/// A Segment is, at its most basic, a collection of BasicSections. The collection MUST be from the same Winding and it must represent an axially contiguous (adjacent) collection of coils.The collection may only hold a single BasicSection, or anywhere up to all of the BasicSections that make up a coil (for disc coils, only if there are no central or DV gaps in the coil). It is the unit that is actually modeled (and displayed). Static rings and radial shields are special Segments - creation routines (class functions) are provided for each.

    // MARK: Static ring geometry (Weidmann drawing EHV00112-2 rev 2, "NOTCHED STATIC RING")
    //
    // The drawing is ~/Documents/MyProjects/Claude/EHV00112_REV_2-SHT_1(Static_Rings).pdf. It leaves ID, OD, T, T1, R1, R2, L, LR
    // and LV to the engineer; the four constants below are the house values, and they are treated as fixed rather than as
    // per-design inputs because nothing in a design file carries them.
    //
    // WHAT A STATIC RING ACTUALLY IS, because it decides what the dielectric code may assume. A pressboard core of thickness T is
    // wrapped in VERY THIN ALUMINIUM FOIL, and the foil is then covered with T1 of Kraft paper per side. So:
    //
    //  - The electrode is the FOIL, at the core's own surface. The core's pressboard is inside it and is at one potential
    //    throughout, so it never appears as a dielectric layer in any gap - only the T1 of Kraft over it does. That is what
    //    DiscToDiscLayerStack builds, and why it puts Paper(T1) and not Pressboard(T) on the far face.
    //  - The foil follows the core's edge, so the ring HAS a corner, of radius R1 = R2. It is not a smooth surface; it is simply a
    //    much more generous corner than a strand's. See DielectricStress.CornerRadius for what a strand gets.
    //  - The lead L bonds the ring to the OUTERMOST TURN of the adjacent disc, so the ring sits at that turn's potential. The
    //    voltage across a disc-to-ring gap is therefore zero at the OD and the disc's whole span at the ID.
    //
    // ID and OD match the adjacent disc, which is what Segment.StaticRing builds (it copies the disc's rect in x). LR and LV, the
    // notch dimensions for the lead, are deliberately ignored: the notch is a local feature at one azimuth and this is a
    // rotationally symmetric model.
