//  Created by Peter Huber on 2026-08-05.
//
//  Electric stress (V/m) screening of an impulse simulation result.
//
//  The point of this file is to find the APPROXIMATE LOCATIONS in a design that need to be redesigned or
//  built with extra care. It is not a substitute for a finite-element study, and it does not try to be:
//  see the accuracy notes on each routine, and the summary in CLAUDE.md.
//
//  Why this does not need FE. Every capacitance routine in Segment.swift is already a series-dielectric
//  reduction, and that reduction IS the field solution. Segment.DiscToDiscSeriesCapacitance forms
//  Σ(ℓ/ε) over the layers in a gap; continuity of the normal component of D then gives the field in each
//  layer directly, with no further approximation:
//
//      D = ε0·V / Σ(ℓⱼ/εⱼ)                     (Gauss, applied across a laminar stack)
//      E_i = D/(ε0·ε_i) = V / (ε_i · Σ(ℓⱼ/εⱼ))
//
//  So the whole screen is a reuse of the geometry the capacitance code already measures, evaluated per
//  gap per time step: of the order of 200 gaps × 2000 steps, i.e. milliseconds. A finite-element solve
//  per time step would be hours.
//
//  THE ALLOWABLES COME FROM DELVECCHIO CHAPTER 13, "Voltage Breakdown Theory and Practice", and they are
//  functions of distance, not constants. See StressAllowable for the equations and their citations. Four
//  distinctions in there must not be collapsed:
//
//      strike (through a gap)      vs   creep (along a surface) - different formulas, different exponents
//      power frequency (rms)       vs   impulse (peak)          - a factor of ~2.8 for oil
//      the design margin           vs   the 50% breakdown level  - the book's data are the latter
//      distance-dependent          vs   a single number          - a factor of two across one coil's gaps
//
//  In particular Segment.woundInShieldMaxWorkingStress (2755 V/mm, 70 V/mil) is a POWER-FREQUENCY working
//  turn-to-turn stress used to size the paper on a wound-in shield. It is not an impulse allowable and is
//  deliberately not used here.
//
//  The average field is the number that carries a margin. The peak (corner) field is reported alongside
//  it as information only: chapter 13's data are uniform-gap measurements compared against AVERAGE fields
//  by the book's own path-subdivision procedure (p.371), so there is no sourced allowable for a corner
//  peak, and inventing one would put a fabricated number beside cited ones.
//
//  WHAT THIS SCREENS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. Every check here is a STRIKE check - breakdown through a gap,
//  across a stack of solid and liquid layers whose thicknesses the model knows. There is no CREEP check:
//  creep sites were built until 2026-08-06 and were removed because the model cannot measure a creep path
//  (a hilo barrier's overhang past the coil ends, and the angle rings and caps on it at high voltage, are
//  not in PhaseModel). The chapter 13 creep allowables are still in StressAllowable, unused and still
//  self-tested; the note above StressAllowable.CreepPowerFrequency says what has to exist first. Until
//  then, creep is a gap in the screen's coverage rather than a clean bill of health - and since creep
//  strength falls with distance far faster than strike strength does, it is not a small gap.
