//  RadialProfileWindow.swift
//  ImpulseDistribution
//
//  Created by Peter Huber on 2026-08-13.
//
//  The conductor-to-conductor voltage across the radial build of a sheet or layer winding: one value per gap, innermost gap first,
//  with the paper-impulse allowable drawn across it.
//
//  WHY THIS EXISTS. The two stress-profile windows plot against HEIGHT, because a disc winding's problem is distributed along the
//  coil. A sheet or layer winding's is distributed across it - the turns run out along a radius, not around a disc - so the picture
//  that answers it has a different x axis and a different unit of resolution. Nothing else in the program looks at either winding
//  type this way: DielectricStress.AppendTurnToTurnSites takes `.disc` and skips everything else, so until this window there was no
//  turn-to-turn or layer-to-layer number for a sheet or layer coil anywhere in the report.
//
//  IT IS ONE INSTANT, NOT AN ENVELOPE, and that is the difference from the other two profile windows. The gaps of a sheet winding
//  are a series chain and the layers of a layer winding are one network, so every gap here is driven by the SAME coil voltage - they
//  all peak together, at the instant that coil's terminals are furthest apart. There is no envelope to take. Which instant that is
//  appears in the annotation, and it is the coil's own worst instant rather than the model's: see AppController.WorstInstant for why
//  the difference matters, and for why t = 0+ is one of the candidates.
//
//  WHAT THE SHAPE MEANS is not the same for the two winding types, and the note under the picker says which is on screen:
//
//   - A SHEET winding is a pure series chain, because every turn is a full-height cylinder that completely screens the next from
//     everything outside the coil. What the chain does depends entirely on whether the coil has COOLING DUCTS in it. With none, the
//     only thing that varies is the gap capacitance's growth with radius - C ∝ r makes ΔV ∝ 1/r, so the innermost gap is worst by
//     exactly the ratio of the radii, a gentle and entirely predictable slope of a few per cent. Put an oil duct in a gap and that
//     is swamped: a 6 mm duct beside 0.2 mm of paper has some fifty times the reduced thickness, so it takes some fifty times the
//     volts, and the profile becomes a flat floor with a spike standing on every ducted gap. Both shapes are real and the picture
//     says which one this coil has.
//
//   - A LAYER winding is a solved network and its profile carries real information: how much more than its share the layer at the
//     line end takes at the wavefront. The reference line in the annotation is the textbook figure, twice the volts per layer, which
//     is what a designer reaches for; the whole point of the solve is to say where the coil departs from it.
//
//  The drawing is StressProfileView, shared with the two stress-profile windows so that a reader moving between them is not misled
//  by a change in the furniture. What this window adds to it is the ordinal x axis - see StressProfileView.XAxis.
