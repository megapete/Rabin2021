//
//  Voltage-difference-versus-height profiles for the radial checks of the dielectric stress screen.
//
//  This is the picture that answers the unequal-height coil problem: when a tapping winding sits outside a main winding and is not
//  the same height, the radial voltage difference between them is not remotely uniform, and the worst of it is at the short coil's
//  end. A ranked table says which height is worst; this says why, by showing the whole profile with the coil ends marked.
//
//  It plots an ENVELOPE, not an instant. Each point is the largest radial difference that height saw at any time in the run, so one
//  curve covers the whole transient. An animation over time was considered and rejected: the radial peak at one height and the peak
//  at another happen at different instants, so no single frame of an animation shows the thing being looked for.
//
//  The plotting is StressProfileView, shared with AxialStressProfileWindow: same axes, same dashed allowable, same annotation
//  block, so the radial picture and the axial one can be read side by side without a difference in the FURNITURE being taken for a
//  difference in the data. It used to draw into CoilResultsDisplayView, whose x axis carries only end labels ("bottom"/"top") and
//  which has no second series - so this graph could show where the worst height was but not what it was allowed there.
//
//  EITHER QUANTITY IS JUDGED AGAINST ITS OWN ALLOWABLE. Voltage difference is compared with the ΔV that would put the governing
//  layer at its limit, average stress with the limit itself; both come out of the finding as a division by its utilization (see
//  the header of StressProfileView), so the two views of the same profile carry the same margin and cannot disagree about it.
